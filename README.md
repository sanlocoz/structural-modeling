## What is this program about?
This program is about automating strucural modeling tasks using CSi software (ETABS).
CSi offers front end framework that can be accessed through many programming languages such as Python, Matlab, C++.


## Parameter of the program

- Geometry properties
- Material properties 
- Section properties
- Typical dead load
- Typical live load
CSI ETABS front end accessing with Python programming language </br>
Reducing modeling time from 1 hour to 5 minutes, the input data is in spreadsheet
