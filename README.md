# structural-modeling

## What is this program about?
This program is about automating strucural modeling tasks using CSi software (ETABS).
CSi offers front end framework that can be accessed through many programming languages such as Python, Matlab, C++, C# and VBA.
The documentation of the interface could be found in this relative path (assuming we are in application installation folder):

`.\CSi API ETABS v17.chm`

or for an example of default ETABS 18 installation in windows 10 will result in absolute path as follows:

`C:\Program Files\Computers and Structures\ETABS 18\CSi API ETABS v17.chm`

This is the screenshot of the introduction to CSi API (application programming interface):
